When we want to do the forecasting with time-series, we need a stationary time series. The stationary time series are data where there is no trend or seasonality information present in it. The stationary time series is a series with constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocorrelation. We need to find a way to remove trends and seasonality from our time series so that we can use it with prediction models. To do that, we need to understand what is trends and seasonality in-depth to handle it better. Apart from trend and seasonality, some time-series also has noise/error/residual component present as well. We can decompose time-series to see different components. We'll now try to explain the presence of trends and seasonality in this project and how to handle it further with examples."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"45Rwd7bl90YY"},"source":["Trend The trends represent an increase or decrease in time-series value over time.
